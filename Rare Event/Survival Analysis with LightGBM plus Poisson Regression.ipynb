    "we develop a solution to predict how many daily bike rentals are registered under some kind of temporal and weather conditions. The task is in the format of a regression problem where we have to predict a count, this can also remind us a Poisson regression problem where we have to model a discrete variable. Our added value is to change the point of view switching to a survival approach, considering that Time is the number of rentals progressively “reach so far” and the Event is the final count registered at the end of the day.
