t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique for visualizing high-dimensional data.

t-SNE accomplishes this by modeling each high-dimensional point into a two- or three-dimensional space, where similar points are modeled close to each other and dissimilar points are modeled farther away.

It does this by constructing two probability distributions, one over pairs of points in the high-dimensional space and another over pairs of points in the low-dimensional space such that similar points have a highprobability and dissimilar points have a lower probability. Specifically, t-SNE minimizes the Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence between the two probability distributions.

In real-world applications of t-SNE, it is best to use another dimensionality reduction technique (such as PCA, as we do here) to reduce the number of dimensions before applying t-SNE.
By applying another form of dimensionality reduction first, we reduce the noise in the features that are fed into t-SNE and speed up the computation of the algorithm
