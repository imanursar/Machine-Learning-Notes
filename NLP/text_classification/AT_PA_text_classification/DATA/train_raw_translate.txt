compared to restaurants in the surrounding areas of this restaurant food is also average just so so the price is relatively cheaper than other strategic locations but the interior of the restaurant is also quite fast service standards so the point of this restaurant is not special
message burger steak made of minced meat and it comes in an overcooked so it is not left longer part juicy than meat and vegetable juice he juice mixed native was only blended syrup sunquick price is cheap but yes maybe it is because no one can be seeded of food
I personally think there is nothing special about this restaurant is the parking of vehicles is very narrow so I had to park on the roadside when the condition of the restaurant was not too busy at the time and access to the restaurant is also quite bogged down in a certain time because along this street there are also many restaurants to own food mediocre

tau from friends so directly to the scene located somewhat in the housing complex is pretty good but if you expect to meet martabak it is more like a pancake with toppings martabak than martabak probably because my tongue was too happy to taste local martabak hehe so actually I would choose regular martabak hell
martabak seems more suited called pancakes tasted ok with a sweet right not too sweet so make eneg but do not expect a moist texture style sweet martabak because as the name suggests the texture is like a sponge because it also martabak still enjoyable when it's cold and even be kept for a few days at room temperature is relatively expensive when compared to other just once aja hehe i buy

the Monkey golden delicious to drink and chatting casually if eating a small meal possible because I think less suitable for some great eating spots and dark pencahayaanya very less making it unsuitable for a serious chat or business
I think the golden monkey bargain when compared with the restaurant other similar standard in Jakarta said the duo golden monkey expensive than other location is not that great but the concept restaurantnya nice usually school children and college there I rarely clay adults there but the staff was not friendly and polite I feel so uncomfortable

small place clean and predominantly white to function as a meeting place does ok but to place the family dining it does not fit the food just average nothing special chicken picata I tend to be bland fried duck passable iced lemongrass tea I had no flavor serehnya at all we eat sixes and pay thousands of expensive bener
passable only mediocre taste for snacking in Riau area but not a deliberate choice that no allowance here
here is always crowded and queues can be long up to the roadside but tasty and worth it For the try cuanki and batagornya tasty and cheap enough just queue to make tightness and exit points of the somewhat confusing especially when carrying a bowl of meatballs fry heat a little dirty because there are bins on the outside so many flies I feel so uncomfortable
Initially I was curious about the food as if cuanki it turned out to be a kind of meatball dumplings dumplings were given soup buy half portion alone is substantial enough if here should rather pagian so it does not need too queued choose an empty spot near a tree if they left because inside it is very hot somewhat surprising is why the message was not all pay so had to queue up twice tired
sights offered good enough pity his staff friendly menu is not complete and it was mediocre taste does not match the price is too expensive
I come here with some friends for lunch the access road to the location of the cafe is very narrow and steep even some parts broken until there was quite amused with a good view and some art pieces of interest include several sculptures at the outdoor we ordered some food menu after waiting quite old when the food came flavor and zoom disappointing turns out it's also disappointing
I come here with a group of friends and interested because he said the view was nice after watching myself I agree with a good view offered this cafe but must choose where area non-smoking for menikmti view great I ordered the tenderloin steak with soft meat served with fried potato and gravy mushroom but it's not too special when compared to the price which is quite expensive

I had breakfast in the restaurant's floor and I happened to get a seat outside or balcony seat cushion looks much dirt stains very strong wind blowing so uncomfortable having breakfast I suggest if you eat at this restaurant select seating inside for comfort
comfortable place especially at night it is definitely romantic scenery but the food taste as fancy ga overall costs overpriced For family visitors the group of friends or business
we eat and order a snack here because Prev we've eaten in a broom and nyemil in floating market so we ksini to enjoy live music but unfortunately cut no live music mgkn because weekdays and resto very quiet once allows for the waiter and waitress voice is very big beat the sound of music imaginable bad experience we ordered fried potatoes advanced
"the peak is a good place for dinner with friends and family with enough food tasty and a nice view of the ambience is also good with a classical decoration of the corner to the entrance, but it seems a bit overprice their food and its presentation is also quite a bit longer"

bornga this restaurant just opened a few months and the floor above it all boutique variety of dishes are served from the menu pork beef and vegetable flavors and combinations of diet is also very tasty to the tongue of Indonesia service from the waiters restaurant also very good and polite

fast friendly service and clean place even though it is expensive but it is offset by the delicious taste
pepper lunch in tsm concept is slightly open in my opinion much better than that in PVJ so while eating can be looking around for in terms of food pepper lunch never disappoints always high quality in terms of taste and raw materials servants was attractive and granting services nice and always explain to customers how to cook food even further
the same with the other lunch pepper restaurant just because the restaurant has its own seating area so that when crowded it easier to find a seat

capital only big name saung Pengkolan group was able to boost the number of visitors to this restaurant and its location is exactly opposite the village elephant makes this restaurant immediately seen by many people sorry to say nothing special dish that standard prices are also standard atmosphere of the restaurant which is very unusual coincidence I chose Lesbian hmmm conditions are inadequate and dirty sticky mats that reduce the enjoyment regular menu is also continued
I think passable but less spicy sauces tasty atmosphere here just because of the cool air to taste the food mediocre in my opinion the main street location makes it easy for the access
the same way a family to eat soto bandung this resto and fast ministry cow obese message is also relatively affordable price cold atmosphere makes eating so want to add
"I would suggest this resto quite ok food was quite tasty but not exceptional to my own place, too heck've ever meal here happens to be a standard place was in the valley area"
places to eat with reasonable prices and food that tastes good enough to sitting on the floor or sit in the chair there is a fish pond across the room inside the restaurant makes the children love to visit this place
stop by here for lunch after of Tangkuban boat we chose the gazebo located above the pool menu rice package liwet for people consists of rice liwet fried chicken village tofu salted fish fried corn cakes sauce vegetables complete taste of the cuisine is quite tasty servings are quite a lot to orng element also fun and cool
Indonesian cuisine with a taste of the foods good service standards a fairly affordable price dining concept Lesbian rural style suitable for a family meal
the food is good and reasonably priced also quite enjoyable atmosphere was not too crowded so it is quite convenient to eat a chat to my knowledge there is bbrp Pengkolan saung locations that we went is that in jl sergeant Bajuri
carp was served in the pepes though wrapped in banana leaves after being fitted spices and steamed enjoyed during the summer increase appetite
it feels pretty good and reasonably priced Sundanese dishes like fried chicken grilled fresh vegetables carp etc please note hygiene mat in lesehannya
we were on our way to dent hungry when viewed Saung Pengkolan we stopped for a meal we chose Lesbian in the floor so get a beautiful view of our order was the calamari fried carp fried crispy sauteed genjer and two menus to know that I have forgotten his name as a whole is not nothing special about the dish probably advanced my selection
when I chose to stay in the valley often this place I make the choice for dinner and very tasty food Sundanese once although not special price offered was not too expensive
"a very tasty food, especially the grilled fish which was very lezattttt and served by friendly employees who bgttt kl to dent lg definitely eat here"

hop hop bubble this drink I think it's a standard bubble other drink I bought a pearl milk tea tastes mediocre use its price is quite cheap compared with other bubble drink but not too many of its variants may be a bit bored so that a couple of times here
hop hop the bubble drinks in the mall Bandung beautiful plaza is one of the pioneers of a typical drink taiwan in the city of Bandung although at this time there are a lot of bubble drinks diverse brands in the city of Bandung but the hop hop still one drink bubbles drinks famous my favorite when buying here is bubbles flavored coffee drinks and many times I asked for extra advanced
This place offers a top-class drinks at exorbitant prices despite that they are creative enough to offer different types of services appetizing menu well and the average waitress who owned a straightforward and efficient in order to prepare
maybe teenagers will love the menu drinks that are sold here but I am not so happy with the odd drink strange besides the price is also relatively expensive for the size of the drinks so they thinkers thinkers often often drink here
in this restaurant you can find typical food menu Cirebon like Empal barrel and rice jamblang feels quite tasty and the price is also affordable
rice jamblangnya less ordinary alias ngena heck wrote menu selection is pretty much no Cirebon typical menu also does Empal barrel rice Lengko know gejrot etc.
aja usual place anyway but I think enough rice original jambangnya Cirebon outside the menu there is also a pretty yummy satay cirebn for young goat and there is also Empal barrel
this restaurant serves noodles and chinese food menu is the famous fried noodles noodle meatball dumplings complete very typical of this restaurant is his noodle specially made himself so the restaurant is also very famous in Bandung with sales of noodles raw eating places quite limited available only a few tables while ample parking because it is in an advanced

jl located in Braga are always full of life especially in the evenings la Baraga offer a variety of foods from around Asia to European and American food minimalist resto lounge is equipped with an interesting live band and dj on a particular evening
He Baraga is located in the middle of the road Braga duo this restaurant provides a selection of food is quite complete from steaks pasta local cuisine and drinks brief review i la Baraga has a strategic location pleasant atmosphere the decor is chic and full music recommendation is oxtail soup grilled slight minus points gravy flavor is too strong cloves sure to ask how long ago Advanced

"satay Hadori located in the surroundings of the station hall duo in the suniaraja home to eat satay, which had long stood presents the skewers of lamb or called sinereut sinereut has a texture that is tender and juicy seasoned only with pepper and a little salt taste will naturally mutton typical but odorless"
do not really like satay but the place of this curiosity with the results of reviews on several sites rather soft satenya standard price services fairly quickly that the place is clean Terpentine
satay and curry goat maknyus makannannya presentation is also very fast place clean enough
so enter this resto already smell typical appetizing to eat satay served fresh in addition to mutton provided beef and chicken in addition to satay there is another menu such as curry tongseng and soup marrow goat satay is very delicious with a choice of peanut sauce and chili sauce with sliced ​​chili meat feels soft and smells of goats continued
satenya enaak ga price kejangkau also regret eating here only place enakeun wrote less noisy because it is close to public transportation terminals duo
satenya very tender with the young goat meat stew using his delicious duo friendly price near the station and new markets
satenya tasty soft guns guns gulenya smell nauseated suitable for aja kpn with family or alone feels ngangeni
"why satay Hadori padded secret is our suppliers to attempt to rise together are supplying mutton to the house to eat satay Hadori stations duo for decades originated from the persistence of our ancestors late Ijon Taryana we become suppliers of mutton for some home to eat satay in the city of Bandung, including rm ampera with branches everywhere to consumers outside the city could be taken further"
attracted by recommendation from friends as well as the results of an Internet search impressive as would satay Hadori is a culinary legend who never missed so our family was struggling from jakarta come here where mediocre but we're used to a place like this because it in the usual places like this hidden Indonesian culinary wonders our family booked in advanced
Very soft goat satay I've ever eaten where it's rather difficult in the search should be a lot of questions
until the night at the station I went straight to the Sate Bandung Hadori located behind the station satay skewers presented her with a large per superb taste in each tusuknya there are pieces of fat delicious
My favorite goat satay even if most could make a genuine vertigo Hadori dekata railway stations did make me miss by nutty flavor and not too sweet kecapnya compared with satay sauce in java
place next to South Station is tender and tasty satay duo fitting fuel not wrong deh here would choose to eat satay skewers select hearts also want lah Klu duo to stop by here again
with price rp rp skewers prepared to spend their money on skewers guaranteed odorless goat meat is tender and you can ask for a longer baking is not to your liking crowded soup bones and maknyus
cases which for me really miss the city of Bandung is its very tasty satay was very loss of all for the tourist who come to Bandung but can not take this sate
The legendary duo skewers tender goat meat mixed with curry sauce and pickled feels like to add continuously rice
"its locations around the train station of public transportation terminals duo surrounding neighborhood looks seedy, but not discourage us to try and enjoy a dish of satay skewers Hadori taste amazingly tasty and tender as good here for dinner"
satay Hadori in teak garden path is a young goat satay no in Bandung her tender flesh of her peanut sauce is also delicious again
this is easy if you want to place a place next to the Bandung station and maturation fitting padded satenya
easily accessible because it has many branches spread across the city of Bandung meat tender and perfectly baked with savory and spice
one satay which are well known and often discussed from the first to rather soft goat satay taste is not too disappointing gulenya quite tasty and the portions rather many food stalls where a sort of quite large and located in the terminal hall st duo
at the rear in the terminal station that many angkotnya not hard to find a place to eat is the sate will be made so our message cuts of meat sliced ​​from fresh and immediately burned the meat tender and juicy without seasoning was already delicious especially when dipped into the marinade
Hadori satay is quite famous in Bandung if not able to visit the location in the center you can also find satay Hadori in several places to eat like Paskal Hypersquare and the kiosk
satay chicken is juaraaa satenya tender and tasty although not eaten with the sauce goat satay is also quite tasty soft and not smell himself quite felt that all of the ingredients the ingredients fresh if curry goat seems to us less fortunate maybe because we were already curfew and that served at gulenya just fat without meat
"to issue Hadori taste satay satay is one of the best I have ever eaten a hefty price for a rb rp drain bag puncture however commensurate with the satisfaction derived but the location of the original stalls behind the station bdg may seem shabby, so less comfortable apalgi if with family"
to go a bit easy access just around the state is still lacking clean and parakeets less structured if the taste is pretty good
"satay Hadori is one home to eat satay is quite famous in Bandung location somewhat hidden, but easy to find location near the station hall duo the back door of the station contained monument ancient locomotive once you discover the locomotive immediately seek the parking lot located just around from the locomotive TSB toward public transportation terminals after asking park advanced"
This goat satay taste different from other places visitors busy from noon till night reasonably priced meat is tender and savory sauces from chilli and mortar tasty peanut sauce
tender meat peanut sauce is also very fit her taste Ko Ko favors the price is not too expensive under rebu eat both a portion of rice satenya two he he he
most like the same section coz fat melted in the mouth just a pity the meat was rather tough satay marinade distinctive appeal in general
yummy food tasty and strategic place so my choice of celebrating the anniversary every year with him thanks
food in order cold ga taste new cook to taste so so lah mixed juice is also taste less fresh rich instead of fresh juice or puree of the fruit where ordinary aja ok for a social gathering but less ok for family ministry less friendly not quick enough to order food aja until calling repeatedly
"cozy and comfortable place hefty price a bit expensive, but it feels good so fitting suitable for gathering and hanging out at friends or for a family event is also okay"
atmosphere cozy restaurant food taste delicious with medium prices varied menu suited to the atmosphere of gathering with friends or family
while attending a family event held at le marly then the thought is that the pantry is typical with typical menu also turns my guess was correct menu is offered's brilliant proportional to the price as well as the drinks but for a week night so the wait time from ordering until the food arrives took more than a minute in fact no problem continued
dining with unique decor that is in the bottle menu and the decor is cozy and sweet pancakes tasty food also smootiesnya
breakfast lunch until dinner makananya enakkkkk all the drink menu is also intriguing element unikkk funny cool photo images can create a social gathering place strategically birthday etc. buangettttt

resto very strategic location in front of the hotel fave suki menu is pretty good and complete service both affordable prices suitable for dining with family
"dimsum here variations much the price is reasonable and most importantly delicious no table reserved for serving a wide variety of additional ingredients for dimsum like garlic variety of ketchup and sauces so diners can enjoy dim sum with flavors more diverse usually dimsum is not considered kosher because some kinds of dimsum use pork, but here dimsumnya kosher"

select a place on lgsg interchangeable sunset view Sundanese-style food is good and affordable tp getting colder in the valley evening so not long after eating immediately return next want to stop by here when lg in valley
a trip to the valley when it crawled for a long time because the traffic was so congested stomach we had already started to be filled now there is one option that is stopped at this restaurant we chose saung lesehan put us at ease from here we can monitor the atmosphere of the highway down there to eat well while waiting for the little roll
Sundanese food is generally equal spiced fish karedok and others that are generally slightly sweet forth but in dsdl you can enjoy the specialties of Sundanese with spicy level that is different from sundanese normally and here also provide a place to eat stage of bamboo and I suggest taking place which is at the top in order to see the sights of the township area

taste of the food in the restaurant Sundanese I think this is very bad some of the menu I tried the whole tastes good like a carp grilled chicken hiding sauces etc. The price does middling not cheap jg but according to taste just the location of the restaurant is a bit far from the city center so it requires travel time passable if you're in downtown bandung
culinary served at the restaurant seuhah da pepper according to the tongue of the east there are interesting me is chicken menu hide karedok and piter jeans until I noticed how to process them for dishes piter jeans very unique turns of processed bananas and jengkol but not pungent odor like that we often encounter essentially need to try and visit this restaurant

PVJ is one mall high end tenants fairly complete and diverse I am quite satisfied if the visit here for quite a lot of choice would probably be good if there is a food court mall I think this is ugly operational example parking lot is often changed to change sometimes maintenancenya ugly so it looks dirty
Detailed mall palatable to the shopping street and there are cinemas for many branded shopping so need the appropriate budget

I visited this restaurant about an hour afternoon I came with my friend we took a table that is inside the hut we ordered rice tutug oncom rice lead complete specials and various kinds of fried This restaurant provides a variety of choices of sauce that we can take depends on the our tongue tastes
this restaurant provides various types of sauce that was tasty and nonjok pedesnya food served is typical Sundanese food
when in Bandung many dining options serving Sundanese food but for me one of the best choices is rm cibiuk especially her fried carp dish roasted highly recommended for foodies when visiting Bandung
serawung leaf sauce with tomato and chili sauce flavor that makes the city in arrowroot whose name is so famous cibiuk this sauce can be enjoyed with or fried carp with fried chicken tastes very good addition to the lengkokng cibiuk also has many branches
Sundanese food tasted equally good in general and the taste of the dish but try menu rice lead in cibiuk feels different because of my incredible sauces instead enthusiasts spicy dishes but taste chili in cibiuk feels good on the tongue
resto quite clean and provide a place of worship that is clean Sundanese menu and is perfect for fans of various types of sambal
Sundanese food clearly looking cibiuk yaa dong with sudden sauce and crispy savory fried carp hmmmmm steady assortment of drinks diverse menu selection is quite similar price to other Sunda resstoran try deh cibiuk

not many restaurants in Bandung serving food menu bali especially with an authentic taste of this gluttonous betutu decades already exist in the city's development with the flagship chicken and duck betutu taliwang feels satisfactory in terms of both portions and prices
a combination which is actually rather strange to me because eating typical foods bali in Bandung restaurant location is very strategic and can be reached easily for shopping at cihampelas menu is their anchor betutu to choose variations of tastes ranging from spicy to very spicy apart chicken is also a duck bETUTU same flavor variations
"the food is good especially the sauce but the drinks there, I was a bad taste is also quite long wait but relieved by food taste delicious"
Her cozy place with a unique interior I pesen take away with white rice menu veal and crab sauce was quite tasty package can choose the level of spiciness unique with chunks of garlic mixed with savory and delicious overall I like
Louisiana style seafood eating places are again happening although the price is a bit makal but it felt good taste delicious sauce and seafoodnya not disappoint
"comfortable place because of the distance from one table to another is quite within the food was delicious, especially the menu package crab sauce is quite spicy but still good to continue to eat let alone with rice or bread served with the menu you can order rice or bread extra because I think a lot less than crab and other dishes that many"
I happened to visit Bandung No recommendation that of a friend that dancing crab in Bandung I know that the restaurant is well known in singapore and also in Jakarta on the occasion of my visit to the restaurant dc in Bandung maybe we often enjoyed the crab cakes in a variety of restaurant in the asian region as hk singapore and jakarta
