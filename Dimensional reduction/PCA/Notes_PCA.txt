Incremental PCA
from sklearn.decomposition import IncrementalPCA
	perform PCA incrementally in small batches, where each batch is able to fit in memory

Sparse PCA
from sklearn.decomposition import KernelPCA
	The sparse PCA algorithm searches for linear combinations in just some of the input variables, reducing the original feature space to some degree but not as compactly as normal PCA.

kernel PCA
from sklearn.decomposition import KernelPCA
	which runs a similarity function over pairs of original data points in order to perform nonlinear dimensionality reduction.
